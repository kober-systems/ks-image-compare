= KS Image Compare

When creating GUI's, sometimes changes to the code will change the
appearance of the GUI in unexpected but often subtle ways. KS Image
Compare shows any GUI changes and visually display their differences. It
can be easily integrated into git (or any other VCS) to alert you about
any changes.

KS Image Compare is also perfect for checking modifications after
editing photos or graphics!

== Description

KS Image Compare takes two images as inputs and shows the discrepancies
between them. Useful for comparing edited versions of pictures or
verifying adjustments made in graphic design projects.
